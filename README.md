# Whitlock Lab Bioprinting GCode Tool

A terminal-based tool I developed to parametrically generate GCode files for the Cellink BioX 3D printer. 
Existing slicers did not have sufficient precision or customization of different print properties for scientific
research so I programmed my own.

Here's a photo of an osteochondral scaffold printed using a GCode generated by this program.
